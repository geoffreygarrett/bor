# Knowledge Repository

Welcome to the Knowledge Repository. This repository serves as a central location for storing and managing documents,
notes, scripts, multimedia, and other relevant resources. Here's a breakdown of the repository structure to help you
navigate and contribute effectively.

## Structure

### Library

The `library` directory contains academic papers, publications, and other documents categorized by subject. Each subject
has its own subdirectory.

- `library.bib`: A global BibTeX file containing references for the documents.
- `subject...`: Subject-specific directories containing related PDFs.

### Notes

The `notes` directory contains markdown files, notes, summaries, and other text-based information related to the
documents in the library.

### Scripts

(Optional) The `scripts` directory hosts automation scripts, data processing tools, or other code that supports the
knowledge base.

### Data

(Optional) The `data` directory holds raw datasets, spreadsheets, or other data files relevant to the research or
studies.

### Images

(Optional) The `images` directory stores images, charts, diagrams, or other graphical resources.

### Multimedia

(Optional) The `multimedia` directory is for videos, audios, or other multimedia files connected to the knowledge base.

### Tools

(Optional) The `tools` directory contains specific tools, plugins, or binaries that are part of the knowledge management
system.
